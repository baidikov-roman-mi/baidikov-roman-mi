# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Baidikov Roman ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

I'm an 18-year-old passionate developer on a journey to explore and master the world of web development to become a FullStack developer. 

## My **skills** include :

## About my expirience :

I started learning code when I was 13. I even learned new skills from such a [simple project](https://github.com/baidikov-roman-mi/my-first-webpage-in-13-years). To be honest, this "creation" makes me laugh now

But, `I'm moving on`. I'm mostly diving into [React](https://react.dev/learn), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) and so on. You can see my [newest done project](https://github.com/baidikov-roman-mi/react-minesweeper) to see that

## Future vision :

I want to become more skilled, so I want to learn in the coming years:

## Exploring the Code Universe :

I find joy in finding different problems and `solving them with "wild passion"`
