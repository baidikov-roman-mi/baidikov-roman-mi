## About Me

I started learning code when I was 13. I even learned new skills from such a simple project. 

I decided to leave my old project on my Github. To be honest, this "creation" makes me laugh now, but in the past, I was quite proud to have "mastered" CSS and HTML. Now, I'm moving on. I'm diving into React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and so on.

### Exploring the Code Universe

I find joy in exploring code, experimenting with different problems and solving them with "wild passion". 

My goal is not just to write code, but also to gain new communication and technical skills in the company of other programmers to fully dive into the world of web programming.

### Passion for Innovation

Driven by a passion for innovation, I am constantly looking for new ideas and creative approaches to solving problems. 

Whether it's front-end development with React and TypeScript or back-end development with Node.js, I'm always ready for a challenge.

### Current Focus

Currently, I am focused in React, TypeScript and Node.js. In future I want to learn Go, SQL and so on.
